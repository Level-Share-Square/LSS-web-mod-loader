Place your images in the images folder and make sure the file names match that of the target image.
Images must be the same size AND the replaced sprites must be on the same location in the image.
Make sure to remove anything that is left unchanged from the spritesheet to prevent conflicts with other mods.

To load your modpack, use the extension to load the folder and make sure you configured `loader.json`
Keep in mind mods are *NOT* guaranteed to be compatible with future versions of the game you made it for.
Mods may not work perfectly due to limitations put by the game on modding for the sake of optimization

You can place info about your modpack here for the user to read (authors, what it changes, etc.)
